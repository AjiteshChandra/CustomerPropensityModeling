# Propensity Modeling in Finance
Propensity modeling is a particular approach to identify customers who are likely to take a bank loan, which helps financial organizations to optimize their campaign targeting, leading to lower operational costs. The data in this project includes customers banking history information. The goal is to predict the likelihood of a customer taking a loan who already possesses credit cards. This project provides an analysis of transaction patterns of different customers and includes building machine learning models like logistic regression, naive bayes, and random forest and comparing their evaluation metrics to finalize the model that helps in identifying the credit loan potential of a customer.

# Libraries required

- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
